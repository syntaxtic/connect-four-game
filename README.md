**Settings:** The game board size could be edited easily by updating the variables in the state of Game component. Just update: *tableHeight*, *tableWidth*, *numberOfConnection*.

For example, if you would like to make a *Connect Five* game on a 6x10 board:
<img src="ss/6x10.png" title="Game on Bigger Board" width="250"/>
